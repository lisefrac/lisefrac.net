As a web developer, I've worked professionally in web engineering since 2009, but I've been slinging HTML as a hobby since the dawn of the web. Over that time the web has changed, and my role has variously been called "web producer," "web developer," "frontend engineer," and many more.

I'm experienced at turning a designer's vision and a back-end developer's data structures into a user-friendly, accessible website, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've been called a "tenacious" problem solver, and one of my specialties is solving gnarly problems in large codebases with obscure technology.

Additionally, I have two years of experience managing and coaching a small team of engineers. Here I'm known for exceptional empathy towards my direct reports, fighting relentlessly to get them what they need to do their best work.

As I am currently between jobs, I'm focusing on upskilling. Right now my most important  self-enrichment projects is this website (in particular, rebuilding a creaky WordPress site in Hugo).
