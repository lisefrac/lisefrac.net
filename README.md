## Posts

Lots, dating back to 2010. I'm not importing all of them -- I'm trying to stick to evergreen content. (Or should I include eg. weekly updates?)

## Categories

"Blog" was the parent category of all of these. We don't need that.

I used "craft" at the end of titles to differentiate them from the portfolio categories? I think?

- Books
- Costuming
- Fanfic Journal
- Larp
- Webdev Craft
- Weekly Updates
- Writing Craft
- Web Portfolio
  - Web Development
    - Email
    - Social Media
    - Websites
- Writing
  - Fanfiction
  - Short Story

# Proposed Changes

## Pages
- Delete the old stuff (eg. Latti Anderson, holiday 2019 page?)
- For web portfolio:
  - Ones with code can live in GitHub (Teamer, RTG, lisefrac.net) with READMEs
  - Otherwise maintain? But they need to be more digestible, I think -- that OneCMS one goes *on*. 
- I don't think you can do nested categories with Hugo/this theme?
